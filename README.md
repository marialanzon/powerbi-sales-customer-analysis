##  Business Insights

- Product sales are under-leveraged compared to services. Promoting best-sellers like dog treats or birthday cakes could increase profit.
- Customer growth is steady. Monthly transaction count grows faster than new customers, indicating higher retention or upselling.
- Services dominate revenue. However, products offer better margins per item and can boost profitability if promoted more.
